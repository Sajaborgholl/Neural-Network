Simple Neural Network Project

Project Overview
This project implements a simple feed-forward neural network to classify data from a Kaggle. The goal is to familiarize with GitHub workflows, neural network implementation, and training a model on a supervised learning dataset.

Dataset

Dataset Name: Breast Cancer Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faysalmiah1721758/breast-cancer-data
Description: This dataset contains patient data such as age, tumor size, node involvement, and other characteristics that could influence the recurrence of breast cancer. The target variable (class) indicates whether each case was followed by a recurrence or not.
Preprocessing: The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features for optimal neural network performance.

Model Architecture
This project uses a simple feed-forward neural network with the following structure:

Input Layer: 9 input features
Hidden Layers: 1 hidden layer with 16 units, followed by ReLU activation and dropout (0.5) for regularization.
Output Layer: 2 units for binary classification (recurrence vs. no recurrence)
Loss Function: Cross-Entropy Loss
Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001
Hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, and number of units per layer were tuned to achieve better accuracy and prevent overfitting.

Results
The model was trained and evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation to ensure robustness. Here’s a summary of the performance:

Cross-Validation Accuracy: ~72.79%
Final Test Accuracy: ~77.59%
The performance suggests [brief insights, e.g., overfitting in some folds, possible imbalances, or complex patterns that the model struggled to learn]. Future work could include experimenting with additional layers, optimizing hyperparameters, or using more advanced architectures to improve accuracy.
